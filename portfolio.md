## Praxis

Praxis is an Android app that helps University of Granada Medical School's students to manage and organize their medical practices.

It provides a list of the available practices for the student where you can view more information about them and evaluate the teacher when the practice is over.

## Eat the Burger!

Eat the Burger! is a game for Android where your character have to eat all the fast food that falls from the sky and avoid the healthy ones (any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence). 

You can download the code for this app [here](https://github.com/Schbk77/Practica8-PMDM).

## Forever alone Bot

You can download the code for this app [here](https://github.com/Schbk77/Practica2-PSP).
